Version History:
---------------

0.91.2: Added Mata functions introduces in the 20jan2006 update to Stata,
  and added the ado-hacks.el file, which includes a function defined in
  Stata 22, but not earlier: line-number-at-pos. This handy function is
  good for complicated indentations and for jumping back to the beginning
  of commands... but missing it will break emacs 21.whatever.

0.91.1: Separated change history off.
. changed format of new history entries
. changed all my addresses to my new job forgot this in 0.91.0.
. changed behavior for saving files to be more emacs-like.
.. When saving a file under its old name, there is no confirmation, like usual
   emacs saving
.. if ado-mode, ahem, corrects the file name *and* there is a saved file of that
   name in the default directory already, it *will* prompt, to avoid mistaken
   overwrites. 
.. thanks to Brendan Halpin for pointing this out
. fixed some minor programming badness, such as using insert-file when
  insert-file-contents was the proper command to use.
. fixed and improved indentation, so that continued commands with embedded
  comments are indented properly.
. fixed bugs in indentation when using a semi-colon for the delimiter
. changed method for comment indentation, so that /* and */ on different
  lines will line up, with the text on in-between lines indented to one
  extra level of indentation. (requested by Patrick Ball) 
. Mata changes
.. added new faces for current mata keywords, future mata keywords, and
   mata functions (though the mata function face defaults to the regular
   function face.
.. included all the mata functions, as far as I can tell.
.. did not change anything else with indentation for Mata functions.

0.91.0: Fixed highlighting to work with all new Stata commands
  except the new Mata commands. They will arrive in another update.
  No real changes to the underpinnings.

0.82.5: Fixed numerous problems with indenting and moving to
  the beginning and end of commands when using semi-colons as
  the delimiter. Bound M-e to ado-end-of-command. Fixed the
  behavior of this and ado-beginning-of-command. 

0.82.4: Hacked the highlighting to make embedded strings, a la
  `"this is "embedded", you know"'
  look right. Emacs won't treat them properly internally, but
  at least they will look like strings.

0.82.3: Added the new commands related to time series from the July 23,
  2004 update of Stata. Made the now obsolete -varfcast- and -varinf- show
  up as obsolete.

0.82.2: Fixed the bug where ado-mode got confused by opening .do files
  which had subprogram defined in them.

0.82.1: Added the new commands, macro extended commands and new SMCL
  directives from the July 1, 2004 update of Stata. Minor stuff.

0.82: Changed behavior when -do- files are saved to fix the bug that would cause 
  -do- files which defined programs to get saved as -ado- files named after the 
  first locally defined program. Other bug fixes for highlighting of some
  lesser-used constructions.

0.81: Changed behavior of open and close quotes (` and ') so that they no longer
  behave like parentheses, meaning that they don't flash and don't affect indentation.
  This should have been done earlier when ' was allowed for matrix transposition.

0.80: Serious upgrade: made to work with Stata 8, customization groups added,
  font-locking made more flexible, buffer-local changes to indentation and
  the like added.

<0.80: Updates for Stata changes - out-of-date emacs code.
